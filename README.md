# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Using_ML


## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The project involves data analysis, visualization, and the development of predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as name, age, gender, class, and more. The dataset is provided in the `data` directory.

## Analysis and Visualization

The data is thoroughly analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization can be found in the `notebooks` directory.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning algorithms are employed to create predictive models. The algorithms used include:
- Logistic Regression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- GaussianNB
- KNeighborsClassifier
- SVC

### Logistic Regression Model

Among the various algorithms tested, the logistic regression model stands out with a cross-validation score of 81%. This indicates its robustness and reliability in making survival predictions. The model achieved an accuracy of 77%, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying passengers into survival and non-survival categories.
